# Exploratory Data Analysis for failure predictions using machine learning

Goal of this sample is to acceleratre deployment of [Industrial IoT Connectivity Patterns](TODO). There is no one size fits all solution, as there are many [considerations](TODO), please review them before moving your workload to production.

## Add Simulated Data Module

- Deploy simulated sensor device edge module
- Verify data in data explorer
- Verify data in data lake
