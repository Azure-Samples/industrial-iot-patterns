# Operationalizing machine learning models with near real-time api & dashboards

Goal of this sample is to acceleratre deployment of [Industrial IoT Prediction Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/iiot-patterns/iiot-prediction-patterns). There is no one size fits all solution, as there are many considerations, please review them before moving your workload to production.

In the previous step we used some of the [Exploratory Data Analysis](../5_ExplorationDataAnalysis/README.md) techniques to select initial features for model and also perform a baseline modeling to understand what algorithms may work well with our dataset. For this sample we will
