# Operationalizing machine learning based prediction models

Goal of these samples is to acceleratre deployment of [Industrial IoT Prediction Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/iiot-patterns/iiot-prediction-patterns). There is no one size fits all solution, as there are many considerations, please review them before moving your workload to production.
